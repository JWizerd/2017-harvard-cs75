STEPS:
[X] 1. Parse CSV using yahoo finance .csv files and endpoints
[X] 3. Allow user to create account
[X] 4. When user creates an account for the first time they get   $10,000 added to their account budget
[] 5. User can add or sell stocks (only whole stocks not partial stocks)
[] 6. Use relational databases (MySQL) to best organize data i.e. a users table, a stocks table (without price due to elasticity of stocks)
* maybe have some way of keeping track of stock growth by querying csv files every day and then persiting that total to a users portfolio db.
